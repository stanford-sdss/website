          <p>We are working to highlight data that are most relevant to your work and encourage you to share your data. Some topics you can explore include air pollution, extreme weather events, agriculture, and more. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/explore#q=Which%20counties%20in%20the%20US%20have%20the%20most%20smoke%20pollution%3F">Which counties in the U.S. have the most smoke pollution?</a></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Data source: Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability associate professor Marshall Burke’s Echo Lab
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="/explore#q=which+counties+in+california+have+the+lowest+proportion+of+power+lines+underground&client=ui_query">Which counties in California have the lowest proportion of power lines underground?</a></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Data source: Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and School of Engineering associate professor Ram Rajagopal’s Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>If you would like your datasets transformed into visual assets, or you have a need that you wish this tool would meet, please <a href="mailto:sdss-gcp_datacommons-admins@stanford.edu">send an email</a> with your ideas.</p><br>
          <h2>Why should you include your data?</h2>
          <p>Stanford’s Data Commons for Sustainability enables researchers, citizens, journalists, policymakers, nonprofits, and private sector decision makers to find public data and explore connections between data sets.</p>
          <p>Whether you’re looking to understand sustainability at the level of a community, an industry, or our planet, or to develop data-driven stories about sustainability, Data Commons for Sustainability allows you to consider questions and visualize data using plain language instead of code.</p><br>
          <h2>A growing resource for understanding Earth, climate, and society</h2>
          <p>Data Commons for Sustainability is powered by <a href="https://datacommons.org/">Google's Data Commons</a>, a system that brings together data from multiple public sources such as government agencies and intergovernmental organizations. Data related to Earth, climate, and society from Stanford University scholars will be added over time.</p><br>
          <h2>About this project</h2>
          <p>As part of our commitment to accelerating solutions, deepening knowledge of Earth, climate, and society, and making sustainability education broadly accessible, the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability is working to make sustainability data easier for people and organizations to find and use. This effort includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Training and support for Stanford researchers using Data Commons.</li>
            <li>Identifying and integrating new data sets produced by our scholars and programs</li>
          </ul>
